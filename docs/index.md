A collection of useful nodes to help with time based automation.  

Despite the large number of timer nodes available for node red i never found one i was satisfied with.  Some were far too simple and others way too complicated.  In the end i made my own which are indended to be reliable & easy to use with a clean design.

### Timer Node
Daily on/off timer node that supports fixed times of the day or sun events.  Useful for setting timers such as lights that go on when its dark and off of at a fixed time.
